![Greetings!](./media/hello.jpg)
Welcome! Having a little too much time over break (or rather break-induced boredom), I've managed to finally bite the bullet and make this math blog. My goal in creating this website-blog is to document the math projects and problems that I find interesting. Ideally (when I find time again), I will be adding some functionality to this website as I become more familiar with javascript and Gatsby. In the meantime, I hope some of y'all will find this blog useful and thought provoking!
